This project is a dice game built with React.js where we made use of various React.js and Javascript techniques to develop the game's logic,
and we used some HTML and CSS on the game's interface.

# About the game

The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

roll - If the player rolls a
1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
You are playing against the computer. The red triangle indicates the current player. Hover over the pig to get the optimal decision.
